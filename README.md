eBird will shortly email you a zip file, download this zipfile and **Extract the contents**.

Open the ShinyApp in R, and change your working directory to the location you downloaded the shinyApp to. Select all code and hit run.
You may have to install the required packages listed at the top of the page.

Once you run the app in R it will pop up an html page. Use the Browse button to browse to the **UNZIPPED** file of your observations.

Enjoy!
